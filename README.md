Welcome to SurvBot, a modern GenAI implementation of Image Captioning using Moondream VLM. The modern surveillance systems are becoming one of the most annoying sources of data that we fight on a daily basis with. With users putting dozens and dozens of CCTV Cams over their campuses, any scope of objective video tagging is a nightmare.

We use Moondream, an easy to use modular and mind you, very very very tiny VLM, to image caption footages as they are fed into the Streamlit based web application. We then use a combination of Pandas and Streamlit Native CSV functions to let the end user persue through the Video Tagged CSV find points of interests.
